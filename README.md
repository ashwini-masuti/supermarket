Code for a supermarket that calculates the total price of a number of items

Detail description-
In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy ‘n’ of them, and they’ll cost you ‘y’ pence. For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 pence individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you £1.30. 

The solution allows items to input at the command line, and allow for a final total to be calculated and for a running total after each item is ‘scanned’.

How to execute code-
To execute code , Please run class PayNowForShopping.java, by executing command "java PayNowForShopping A A B B C C D D"
By running it should display the total price of items, for e.g
